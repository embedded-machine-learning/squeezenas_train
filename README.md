# squeezenas_train

## Introduction:
This is a training script for the [SqueezeNAS](https://github.com/ashaw596/squeezenas) models
on the [RailSem19](https://wilddash.cc/railsem19).




## How to start with the script:
In order to start with the script you have to first download the **SqueezeNAS** repository and then download and exctract this repository in the same folder where you have your **SqueezeNAS** scripts. There is a helper repository [HERE](https://github.com/themozel/segmentation_models_pytorch.git) which is also needed to be downloaded into the same directory. Our script is written specifically for **RailSem** so you can also download this from the provided link into the directory and start with the training.

## Environment setup:
For the environmetn setup you can use the `requirements.txt` file in the **SqueezeNAS** repository. The only thing you would need is the openCV package for visulazing the figures.
